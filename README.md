# Showtime OTT: Predictive Modeling Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes viewing patterns and content performance on Showtime's OTT (Over-The-Top) platform to optimize content release strategies and improve viewership metrics. The analysis combines visitor data, advertising metrics, and content performance indicators to derive actionable business insights.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following key metrics:
* **Visitors**: Average number of visitors (in millions) to the platform in the past week
* **Ad Impressions**: Number of ad impressions (in millions) across all content campaigns
* **Views_Trailer**: Number of trailer views (in millions)
* **Views_Content**: Number of first-day content views (in millions)
* **Genre**: Content genre classification
* **Day of Week**: Content release day
* **Season**: Release season
* **Major Sports Event**: Presence of major sports events on release day

## Key Findings

### Content Viewing Patterns
* Most content receives between 0.4-0.5 million views on the first day
* Content viewing distribution shows a slight right skew with predictable patterns
* Strong correlation (0.75) between trailer views and content views

### Genre Analysis
* Balanced distribution across specific genres
* Action content drives highest median visitor numbers
* Romance and Comedy show similar viewing patterns
* Horror, Thriller, and Sci-Fi demonstrate consistent visitor numbers

### Temporal Patterns
* Weekend releases generally attract higher viewership
